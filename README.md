# RFM-Analyst
This project aims to analysis segment of customer bases on RFM Model, so that Marketing team can deploy each marketing program suitable for each customer group.
## Introduction
### 1.What is RFM?
RFM is a marketing analysis technique that stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value.
- Recency: measures how recently a customer has made a purchase.
- Frequency: measures how often a customer has made purchases.
- Monetary Value: measures the total amount of money a customer has spent on purchases.
RFM is used to identify and categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior and how recently and frequently they have made purchases, as well as the monetary value of those purchases.
### 2.How?
In RFM analysis, customers are scored based on three factors (Recency - how recently, Frequency - how often, Monetary - how much), then labeled based on the combination of RFM scores
## Challenges
- The Marketing Department needs to classify the segments of each customer to deploy each marketing program suitable for each customer group.
- The Marketing Director also proposed a plan to use the RFM model in Python to segment customers, and then launch marketing campaigns to thank customers for supporting the company over the past time. As well as exploit potential customers to become loyal customers.
- Suggestions to the Marketing and Sales team with the company's retail model, which of the three indicators R, F, and M should be most interested in?
